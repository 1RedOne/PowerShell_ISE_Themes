Most of these themes were converted from ones on [EclipseColorThemes.org](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org), thanks to [this](https://github.com/akawhoami/psisetheme) nice little script from ["akawhoami"](https://github.com/akawhoami).

The "Visual Studio 2013 Dark" theme is thanks to ["curi0usJack"](https://github.com/curi0usJack), and was found here:  https://project500.squarespace.com/journal/2015/2/16/vs2013-dark-theme-for-powershell-ise. 

The Placidity theme I created myself from scratch, and is my personal favourite. :)

Happy scripting!
